                <h3>Project 1-Product Landing Page</h3>
                <p>Creating a product landing page is one of the most common
                    web development projects for students looking to apply their
                    understanding of web development in real life. A product landing page
                    is a focused web page designed to drive conversions and typically
                    includes product details, benefits, and calls to action</p>

            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Project 2-Temperature Converter Website </h3>
                <p>Developing a website that converts temperature recorded in
                    one unit to another can be an excellent place for web developers
                    to move forward in their web development journey. The measuring units
                    of the temperature recorded in a particular unit can be converted with
                    a temperature converter, necessitating you to build a dropdown menu with
                    temperature scales. You can also more functionality to the website
                    by providing some other converters.</p>
